# Outcome AI — V1 Clickable Demo (Dashboard)

Outcome AI is a **decision intelligence interface** designed to help dealers answer three questions fast:

- **What should we acquire now?**
- **What should we stop buying before it hurts gross?**
- **Where is expected gross quietly at risk right now?**

This repo contains a **single-page, clickable demo** intended for UI + narrative validation.

## Important
This is a **demo environment** using **representative data for illustration**. It is not live dealer data.

## Run locally
Just open `index.html` in a browser.

- macOS: double-click `index.html`
- Optional: use a simple local server for the cleanest experience

## Files
- `index.html` — main dashboard (single page)
- `app.js` — demo wiring (tiles, modals, VIN analyze, toast)
- `demo-data.js` — representative demo dataset

## Notes
- Outcome is designed to **complement** existing tools (DMS/CRM/inventory), not replace them.
- The UI intentionally stays focused on **decisions**, not reporting.
